## Flavio Miranda

<p> I choose to work with Telecom for the reason I never knew  but that always made sense to me. And I went through all the possible stage of a career path, which, in Telecom means start with cabling, connectors, manual and hard work in open areas or inside Telecom rooms. First dealing with Voice network:  Analogic PBX initially and then with Digital PBX. I used to love to work with Philips Sopho PBX, man!!, it was really complicated to me at that time. Remote access with 56K modem??  command line with structured commands syntax??...so many boards in one chassi. 
Then IP Voice network came and I fell in love with Asterisk. I did a lot with Asterisk. One of the project that prouds me mostly  was eliminating Fax machine for a company using Asterisk. Yes, Asterisk was able to handle fax from Fax machine.</p>
    <p>And then I realized that Telephone would be just one of many devices plugged in the network and the network would be totally different from all that stuff IÂ´ve been handly so far.  I decided go to a Networking course in a College and there I got to know Cisco and have access to the Cisco Academy.  Never stoped anymore. Almost 20 years and the certainty that I know nothing.</p>
